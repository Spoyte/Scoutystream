## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Create environment files for each component:

#### A. API Environment (`apps/api/.env`)
```bash
cd apps/api
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:
```env
PORT=4000
CHILIZ_RPC_URL=https://spicy-rpc.chiliz.com
CHILIZ_CHAIN_ID=88882
CHILIZ_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix

# Optional: Real S3 (use mock URLs if not configured)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name

# Payment (start with mock)
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock
COINBASE_X402_API_KEY=your_coinbase_key
COINBASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

#### B. Contracts Environment (`contracts/chiliz/.env`)
```bash
cd contracts/chiliz
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
CHILIZ_RPC_URL=https://spicy-rpc.chiliz.com
CHILIZ_CHAIN_ID=88882
CHILIZ_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix
```

### Step 2: Deploy Smart Contracts

#### A. Deploy Chiliz VideoAccessControl

```bash
# Navigate to Chiliz contracts
cd contracts/chiliz

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Compile contracts
pnpm compile

# Run tests (should show 19 passing)
pnpm test

# Deploy to Chiliz Spicy Testnet
pnpm deploy:spicy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ VideoAccessControl deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef...
üìã ABI copied to API directory
üíæ Deployment info saved to: deployments/VideoAccessControl-chilizSpicy.json
```

**Important**: Copy the contract address - you'll need it for the API!

#### B. Deploy Flow ScoutCredential

```bash
# Navigate to Flow contracts
cd contracts/flow

# Ensure Flow CLI is authenticated
flow auth list

# Deploy to Flow Testnet
./deploy.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ ScoutCredential deployed to: 0xabcdef1234567890...
```

**Important**: Copy this contract address for frontend configuration!

### Step 3: Update Configuration with Contract Addresses

#### A. Update API Configuration
Add the Chiliz contract address to `apps/api/.env`:
```env
CHILIZ_VIDEO_ACCESS_CONTROL_ADDRESS=0x1234567890abcdef...
```

#### B. Update Frontend Configuration
For local development, create `apps/web/.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHILIZ_RPC_URL=https://spicy-rpc.chiliz.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHILIZ_CHAIN_ID=88882
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLOW_ACCESS_NODE=https://rest-testnet.onflow.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLOW_WALLET_URL=https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLOW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xabcdef1234567890...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock
```

### Step 4: Test Local Integration

```bash
# From project root - start both services
pnpm dev

# This starts:
# - API server on http://localhost:4000
# - Frontend on http://localhost:3000
```

**Test the integration:**

1. **API Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/health | jq .services.chiliz.isConfigured
   # Should return: true
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Gallery should load with 8 demo videos
   - Filtering should work (try sport: basketball)
   - Video pages should show payment buttons

3. **End-to-End Flow**:
   - Connect MetaMask (Chiliz Spicy network)
   - Try to watch a video ‚Üí should get payment prompt
   - Use mock purchase ‚Üí should grant access
   - Video should show "ready to stream" state

### Step 5: Deploy Backend to Production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### 1. Frontend Build Fails on Vercel
**Problem**: TypeScript errors or missing environment variables
**Solution**:
```bash
# Test build locally first
cd apps/web
pnpm build

# Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Ensure all NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are set
```

#### 2. API Can't Connect to Contracts
**Problem**: Contract address not configured or invalid private key
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify contract address
curl YOUR_API_URL/api/health | jq .services.chiliz

# Should show: "isConfigured": true
# If false, check CHILIZ_VIDEO_ACCESS_CONTROL_ADDRESS
```

#### 3. Wallet Connection Issues
**Problem**: MetaMask can't connect to Chiliz Spicy
**Solution**:
- Manually add network to MetaMask:
  - Network: Chiliz Spicy Testnet
  - RPC: https://spicy-rpc.chiliz.com
  - Chain ID: 88882
  - Currency: CHZ

#### 4. Flow Contract Deployment Fails
**Problem**: Insufficient FLOW tokens or authentication issues
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check authentication
flow auth list

# Check balance
flow accounts get YOUR_ADDRESS --network testnet

# Re-authenticate if needed
flow auth login
```

#### 5. 402 Payment Flow Not Working
**Problem**: Backend not granting access after payment
**Solution**:
```bash
# Test mock payment directly
curl -X POST YOUR_API_URL/api/videos/1/purchase \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userAddress": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D6C9D6C8A5A3c5f5"}'

# Check if access was granted
curl "YOUR_API_URL/api/videos/1?address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D6C9D6C8A5A3c5f5"
```

   ```env
   # In API .env
   PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock
   # Leave CHILIZ_VIDEO_ACCESS_CONTROL_ADDRESS empty
   ```

2. **Deploy frontend only**:
   - Push to GitHub
   - Connect to Vercel
   - Set environment variables
   - Demo works without real blockchain

3. **Show contract code**:
   - Display `VideoAccessControl.sol` and test results
   - Show `ScoutCredential.cdc` implementation
   - Explain how integration would work

### Full Production Demo (60 minutes)

1. **Deploy contracts** (20 min)
2. **Deploy backend** (15 min)
3. **Deploy frontend** (10 min)
4. **Test integration** (10 min)
5. **Prepare demo** (5 min)
